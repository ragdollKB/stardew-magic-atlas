MAGIC ATLAS<br><br>

A magical map interface that lets you instantly warp to any location in Stardew Valley.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
-----------<br><br>

Magic Atlas provides an elegant grid-based menu with location previews that allows you to instantly warp to any location in the game. The mod includes map thumbnails for all vanilla locations and supports modded locations (including Stardew Valley Expanded).<br><br>

NEW IN VERSION 0.3.0: The Magic Atlas is now an in-game item that can be found in the Town Fountain! Visit the fountain during winter to retrieve it.<br><br>

NOTE: This mod was created entirely with AI. No coding was done by me personally - the entire project was generated using artificial intelligence tools. Even this README file was written using AI, specifically Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 Pro working together to create the documentation.<br><br>
